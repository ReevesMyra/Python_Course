# Purpose:  School assignment to demonstrate passing variables from function to function, while coding a functional game.






# Start the game with all parameters equaling zero as the defaults:

    nice, mean, userName = nice_mean(nice, mean, userName)

    # If it's not a new game, then we will already have their name saved in the "userName" variable and we can thank them for playing again, and then continue on.
